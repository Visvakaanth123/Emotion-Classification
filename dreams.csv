I was running through a dark forest and something was chasing me but I couldn’t see what it was.,Fear
I dreamt I was falling endlessly into a black void and couldn’t scream.,Fear
There was a figure standing at the end of my hallway and it wouldn’t move no matter how much I yelled.,Fear
I was trapped in a room with no doors or windows and I couldn’t breathe.,Fear
I saw my family disappear right in front of me and I couldn’t stop it.,Fear
I was lost in a city where no one could see or hear me.,Fear
A snake wrapped around my body and I couldn’t move or call for help.,Fear
The ground beneath me started crumbling and I was hanging by a thread over a pit.,Fear
I dreamt that someone broke into my house and I had nowhere to hide.,Fear
I was buried alive and I could hear dirt falling on top of the coffin.,Fear
My legs stopped working while I was being chased by someone with a knife.,Fear
I saw a car speeding toward me and I couldn’t jump away in time.,Fear
"I woke up in my dream, but no one recognized me—not even my parents.",Fear
The elevator I was in started free-falling with no end in sight.,Fear
I was surrounded by fire and couldn’t find an exit.,Fear
I dreamt my teeth were all falling out and I was bleeding heavily.,Fear
A voice kept whispering my name but no one was there.,Fear
There were shadows crawling on the walls and they started reaching for me.,Fear
My reflection in the mirror smiled back at me when I didn’t.,Fear
I was forced to relive the moment of my death over and over again.,Fear
